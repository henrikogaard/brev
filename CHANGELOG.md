# Changelog

All notable changes to Brev are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- macOS reader and message-list panes no longer lose their translucent
  look when SwiftUI rebuilds split-view chrome after the last layout
  pass: the transparency repair now verifies its own settled pass and
  re-arms while it keeps finding restored opaque fills. The scroll-edge
  blur band also retries briefly while the material's layer tree is
  still building, and logs (subsystem `eu.brevmail.brev`, category
  `ScrollEdgeBlur`) if it has to disable itself.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Initial public source baseline for the native macOS and iOS apps.
- Native Gmail API support for Gmail and Google Workspace accounts.
- Standards-based IMAP/SMTP support for other mail providers.
- Local-first mail storage, search, compose, settings, and privacy controls.
