/// and wrap to a new row when they would exceed the container's
/// width. Used by the message detail view to wrap recipient chips.
///
/// A child whose ideal width exceeds the container is re-measured
/// within the container width so it truncates or wraps instead of
/// forcing the layout — and the whole window — wider than the
/// proposed width (seen in compose at accessibility text sizes).
///
/// SwiftUI doesn't ship a built-in flow layout in iOS 17 / macOS 14,
/// so this is a small `Layout` implementation sized exactly for that
/// case (rows of single-line chips). It is intentionally not a
/// generalized layout — extend as needed when more callers appear.
